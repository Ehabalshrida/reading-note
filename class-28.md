## Things I want to know more about

### What occured during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer sciene?

*We spent the past few weeks trying to answer this question, and there's no clear, single answer.*

*But here's a good starting place: The share of women in computer science started falling at roughly the same moment when personal computers started showing up in U.S. homes in significant numbers.*


*These early personal computers weren't much more than toys. You could play pong or simple shooting games, maybe do some word processing. And these toys were marketed almost entirely to men and boys.*

*This idea that computers are for boys became a narrative. It became the story we told ourselves about the computing revolution. It helped define who geeks were, and it created techie culture.*

*Movies like Weird Science, Revenge of the Nerds and War Games all came out in the '80s. And the plot summaries are almost interchangeable: awkward geek boy genius uses tech savvy to triumph over adversity and win the girl.*


### Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?

*In the 1990s, researcher Jane Margolis interviewed hundreds of computer science students at Carnegie Mellon University, which had one of the top programs in the country. She found that families were much more likely to buy computers for boys than for girls — even when their girls were really interested in computers.*

*This was a big deal when those kids got to college. As personal computers became more common, computer science professors increasingly assumed that their students had grown up playing with computers at home.*


### What three take-a-ways do you have looking at this data?

- **Prioritize the audience’s understanding over the producer’s ease:** 

*Don’t segment information by the mode of production (or by the team that produced it). It is often tempting to add artificial divisions in work products — reports, presentations, even websites — based on where the content came from or who is responsible for it. This makes things easier for the person creating the report, presentation or website, but doesn’t align with how the end-user will think about the information.*

- **Consider reading time in meetings:**

 *Especially when presenting data-heavy content (such as reports) consider having a reading period at the beginning of the meeting. Prepare a written overview of the content and give participants a few minutes (3-5 minutes per page) at the beginning of the meeting to read it. This allows you to focus your presentation on the main points. It also allows participants to process much more information than they would be able to during the equivalent amount of presentation time (we can read much faster than we can speak). This is NOT the same as asking people to read the full report ahead of time — usually, they won’t! Distributing a handout also promotes accountability and enhances credibility.*

- **Don’t underestimate the audience:**

 *It is natural to want to simplify complex information, thinking that will make it easier for the audience to understand. However, humans can process an amazing amount of information, and simplifying content too much can come across as patronizing or deceptive. One proof point was Google Maps, which is one of the most popular apps in the world and the standard bearer for modern day maps. It also features about 250 data points on a single screen — but this is not too much for users to understand!*


 ### When are diversity efforts most successful?

 *when they’re driven by a commitment from company leaders. And meaningful commitment requires leaders to understand why diversity matters. At Paradigm, we spend a lot of time brainstorming with CEOs and other company leaders about what is or should be driving their diversity and inclusion efforts.*


 ### Why do diverse companies perform better?

 *Given that diverse teams are smarter and more creative than homogeneous ones, it is unsurprising that a wealth of research shows a strong correlation between diverse organizations and positive financial outcomes. In a 2011 study of diversity in the top firms in Standard & Poor's Composite 1500 list, researchers found “female representation in top management leads to an increase of $42 million in firm value.”*
