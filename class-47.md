# AWS: Cloud Servers

## Describe the Web-Request-Response-Cycle

*
The request/response cycle traces how a user's request flows through the app. Understanding the request/response cycle is helpful to figure out which files to edit when developing an app (and where to look when things aren't working)*


## Explain what a “server” is, as it relates to the WRRC

*server computer or software responds to the request by providing the data or service. For example, when you send a spreadsheet to the printer, your spreadsheet program is the client*

## What does it mean to “deploy” an application?

*
Application Deployment (also referred to as Software Deployment) is the process of installing, configuring, and enabling a specific application or set of applications, usually through an application manager (app manager) or software management system, to a specific URL on a server*

## AWS EC2

*Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers. Amazon EC2’s simple web service interface allows you to obtain and configure capacity with minimal friction. It provides you with complete control of your computing resources and lets you run on Amazon’s proven computing environment.*

*Amazon EC2 offers the broadest and deepest compute platform with choice of processor, storage, networking, operating system, and purchase model. We offer the fastest processors in the cloud and we are the only cloud with 400 Gbps ethernet networking. We have the most powerful GPU instances for machine learning training and graphics workloads, as well as the lowest cost-per-inference instances in the cloud. More SAP, HPC, Machine Learning, and Windows workloads run on AWS than any other cloud. Click here to learn What's New with Amazon EC2.*


## Virtual Machines

*
A Virtual Machine (VM) is a compute resource that uses software instead of a physical computer to run programs and deploy apps. One or more virtual “guest” machines run on a physical “host” machine. ... This means that, for example, a virtual MacOS virtual machine can run on a physical PC*

*allow you to run an operating system in an app window on your desktop that behaves like a full, separate computer. You can use them play around with different operating systems, run software your main operating system can't, and try out apps in a safe, sandboxed environment*

*
A virtual machine (VM) is a virtual environment that works like a computer within a computer. It runs on an isolated partition of its host computer with its own resources of CPU power, memory, an operating system (e.g. Windows, Linux, macOS), and other resources*

## Elastic Beanstalk


*AWS Elastic Beanstalk is an easy-to-use service for deploying and scaling web applications and services developed with Java, .NET, PHP, Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, and Docker on familiar servers such as Apache, Nginx, Passenger, and IIS.*

*You can simply upload your code and Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the deployment, from capacity provisioning, load balancing, auto-scaling to application health monitoring. At the same time, you retain full control over the AWS resources powering your application and can access the underlying resources at any time.*

*There is no additional charge for Elastic Beanstalk - you pay only for the AWS resources needed to store and run your applications.*
