# Wireframing

 ## Definition:
   *Wireframing is a practice used by UX designers which allows them to define and plan the information hierarchy of their design for a website, app, or product. This process focuses on how the designer or client wants the user to process information on a site, based on the user research already performed by the UX design team*

 ## Wireframe creation process:
   * Wireframes drawn with paper and a pencil, or at a whiteboard, have the advantage of looking and being very easy to change, which can help tremendously in early conversations about your website or product.

   * With the help of paper-prototypes, you can test with end users at every stage of ideation and design. Changes at these stages are much easier—and therefore cheaper—than changes deemed necessary after coding is under way.

   * Switching later to software (after initially hand-drawing your wireframe) allows you to keep track of more detailed decisions

  ## The best tools for wireframing:
  *There are heaps of free tools, The examples below all have free trials:*

# Mozilla HTML Basics:
 ## Definition:
 *HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.  For example, take the following line of content:*

## The main parts of our element are as follows:

- The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.
- The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.
- The content: This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.
- The element: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.

## Attribute:
  *Elements can also have attributes,which contain extra information about the element that you don't want to appear in the actual content. Here, class is the attribute name and editor-note is the attribute value. The class attribute allows you to give the element a non-unique identifier that can be used to target it (and any other elements with the same class value) with style information and other things.*

  **An attribute should always have the following:**

  1. A space between it and the element name (or the previous attribute, if the element already has one or more attributes).
  2. The attribute name followed by an equal sign.
  3. The attribute value wrapped by opening and closing          quotation marks.


 **Nesting elements**

 *You can put elements inside other elements too *

**Empty elements**

  *Some elements have no content and are called empty     elements.such that<img>*

# Semantics:
*In programming, Semantics refers to the meaning of a piece of code — for example "what effect does running that line of JavaScript have?", or "what purpose or role does that HTML element have" (rather than "what does it look like?".)*
