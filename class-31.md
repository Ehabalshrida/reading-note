## Problem Solving 

**How to Solve Programming Problems?**

*I am going to give you a simple set of steps to follow which you can use for any algorithm type programming problem.*


- Read the problem completely twice.


   *This is the single most important step.  You may even want to read the problem 3 or 4 times.*
   *You want to make sure you completely understand the problem.  A good test of this is whether or not you can explain the problem to someone else.*
  *If you don’t understand the problem, you cannot solve it.  Do not worry about wasting time here, because the better you understand the problem, the easier it will be to solve it.*
  *If you are given any examples along with the problem, make sure you have worked through the examples and understand why the answers are correct for each one.*

- Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.


  *It is very important to solve the problem manually first, so that you know what you are going to automate, otherwise you are just slinging code around.  Which while can be fun, will make you look like an idiot in a programming interview and will probably cause you to sweat profusely.*

- Optimize the manual steps.

*What you want to do here is figure out if there is another way you can solve the problem easier, or if there are some steps you can cut our or simplify.*


- Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.


 *Many times you can skip this step if you have a really good handle on the problem or your previous steps already created a detailed enough description of the solution that coding it is already a 1 to 1 translation.*

- Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.


*This step should be extremely easy at this point.  If you have done all the other steps, this step involves no problem solving at all.
All we do here is take each comment and convert it into a real line of code.*

- Optimize the real code.

*This is also a good place to make sure all your variables are named with long meaningful names.  I cannot stress enough how important having good names for your variables and methods is for helping the person evaluating your code to understand what you were trying to do.  This is especially important when you make a mistake!*


## Act like you make $1000/hr

*If you don’t treat yourself and your time with respect, you will become unhappy, resentful, and tired. Your body and mind long for mastery and freedom; you can’t have those things if your time is cheap and easily taken.*

*You become what you are.*

*You attract what you look for.*

*Back in my early days of writing, I didn’t think I was much of a writer. So I spent a lot of time on low-quality activities, like begging other low-tier/no-name bloggers to let me write guest posts.
No one responded to me. I rarely was invited to write. I think people could see how little I valued myself, and didn’t want to promote my message. I don’t even blame them.*

## How to think like a programmer

*“Everyone in this country should learn to program a computer, because it teaches you to think.” — Steve Jobs*


**So, what should you do when you encounter a new problem?**


1. Understand

*Know exactly what is being asked. Most hard problems are hard because you don’t understand them (hence why this is the first step).*

2. Plan

*Don’t dive right into solving without a plan (and somehow hope you can muddle your way through). Plan your solution!*


3. Divide

*Pay attention. This is the most important step of all.*

*Do not try to solve one big problem. You will cry.*

*Instead, break it into sub-problems. These sub-problems are much easier to solve.*

4. Stuck?

*First off, take a deep breath. Second, that’s fair.*

*Don’t worry though, friend. This happens to everyone!*

*The difference is the best programmers/problem-solvers are more curious about bugs/errors than irritated.*


5. Practice

*Don’t expect to be great after just one week. If you want to be a good problem-solver, solve a lot of problems!*
