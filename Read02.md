  ### Version Control:

  *Version Control is a system that allows you to revisit various versions of a file or set of files by recording changes. Through version control, one can revert a file or project to a previous version, track modifications and modifying individuals, and compare changes. By utilizing a Version Control System (VCS), mistakes with files can easily be rectified*

  **type of version control:**

  ***there are three types of version control:***

  * **Local Version Control**

  *entails one database on your hard disk that stores changes to files.*

 * **Centralized Version Control**
 *This system entails a single server storing all changes and file versions, which can be accessed by various clients*

 * **Distributed Version Control**

 *DVCS allows clients to create mirrored repositories. These data backups can be easily be placed on the server to replace any lost information*


 ### What's Git?
 *is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. Each time you save a changed version of your project — called commit — Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it. If the file has not changed, Git only stores a reference to the already-stored identical version of it*
