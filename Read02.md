  ### Version Control:

  *Version Control is a system that allows you to revisit various versions of a file or set of files by recording changes. Through version control, one can revert a file or project to a previous version, track modifications and modifying individuals, and compare changes. By utilizing a Version Control System (VCS), mistakes with files can easily be rectified*

  **type of version control:**

  ***there are three types of version control:***

  * **Local Version Control**

  *entails one database on your hard disk that stores changes to files.*

 * **Centralized Version Control**
 *This system entails a single server storing all changes and file versions, which can be accessed by various clients*

 * **Distributed Version Control**

 *DVCS allows clients to create mirrored repositories. These data backups can be easily be placed on the server to replace any lost information*


 ### What's Git?
 *it is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. Each time you save a changed version of your project — called commit — Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it. If the file has not changed, Git only stores a reference to the already-stored identical version of it*

 ### History of Git:

 *Git traces its roots to the open source software project Linux kernel. Developers of this project began using a DVCS called BitKeeper in 2002. In 2005, many of these developers stopped using this DVCS due to tension between the Linux kernel community and the company behind BitKeeper’s and the eventual revocation of the DVCS’ gratis status. Subsequently, Linus Torvalds, the chief architect of the Linux kernel, began creating Git. With the intention of creating a DVCS with a workflow design similar to that of BitKeeper, which was also fast, Git allowed for non-linear development via multiple branches, could support large projects, possessed strong mechanisms preventing corruption, and had a simple design. Since its inception in 2005, Git has become one of the most utilized Version Control Systems in the world.*
