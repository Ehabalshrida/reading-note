## Things I want to know more about

### Who is Roy Fielding?

*He's smart*

### Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

*Because they weren't designed to be used like that. When Fielding and his colleagues started building the web, being able to talk to any machine anywhere in the world was a primary concern. But most of the techniques developers later used to get computers to talk to each other didn't have those requirements. You just needed to talk to a small group of machines.*


### What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

*it is all about applying verbs to nouns. For instance, when you go to a web page, the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL you typed in and back comes a web page.*

### What does a GET do?

*GET is used to request data from a specified resource.*

*GET is one of the most common HTTP methods.*

### What does a POST do?

*POST is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource.*


### What does PUT do?

*PUT is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource.*


### What does PATCH do?

*The DELETE method deletes the specified resource.*
